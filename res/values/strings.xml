    <string name="who_are_we">ROBOTIX, is the annual robotics competition held during KSHITIJ, the Techno-Management Fest of IIT Kharagpur which is one of the biggest of its kind.</string>
    <string name="whatdowedo1">Robotix is organised by the Technology Robotix Society, IIT Kharagpur which is the hub of all robotics related activities at IIT Kharagpur and fast becoming the nerve centre of robotics in India.</string>
    <string name="whatdowedo2">At Technology Robotix Society, we constantly endeavour to better ourselves as a robotics fest every year. Our exponential growth over the years, in both quality and quantity of participation, is testament to this fact. However, we are not alone in our growth. With every passing year, our participants have shown a steady improvement in their thinking and innovation in tackling our problem statements. This means that we can never afford to become complacent, and we try to do justice to the increasing quality of bot-making expertise every year.
